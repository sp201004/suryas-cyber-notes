## Objective

This Mystery Chest is a **bonus revision vault** for the entire Cryptography module. It consolidates the most important reference material from every room — Cryptography Basics, Public Key Cryptography, Hashing Basics, and John the Ripper — into one quick-reference place.

Use it as a lookup before a lab, an exam, or an interview. Everything here was covered across the module: the core terms, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing and password storage, digital signatures and PKI, and the command-line tools you drive to audit and recover passwords.

---

## Core Terms

Cryptography starts with a shared vocabulary. These terms recur in every room and underpin every algorithm and tool that follows.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Plaintext** | Original readable data before encryption. |
| **Ciphertext** | Encrypted, unreadable data. |
| **Cipher** | The encryption/decryption algorithm. |
| **Key** | Secret value that drives encryption and decryption. |
| **Encryption** | Plaintext converted into ciphertext. |
| **Decryption** | Ciphertext converted back into plaintext. |
| **XOR** | Bitwise operation returning 1 only when bits differ. |
| **Modulo** | Returns the remainder after division. |

> **Security relevance:** Modern cryptography assumes the algorithm is public — only the key is secret. Confusing plaintext with ciphertext, or assuming secrecy of the algorithm provides protection, leads to broken designs.

---

## Symmetric vs Asymmetric

The central split in encryption is whether both parties share one secret key or each party holds a public/private key pair. Symmetric is fast for bulk data; asymmetric solves key exchange and identity.

| Property | Symmetric | Asymmetric |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Keys** | One shared secret key | Public + private key pair |
| **Speed** | Fast, efficient for bulk data | Slower, for small data |
| **Main use** | Encrypting large amounts of data | Key exchange, signatures, identity |
| **Examples** | AES, ChaCha20, DES, 3DES | RSA, Diffie-Hellman, ECC |
| **Challenge** | Sharing the key securely | Computationally expensive |

> **Security relevance:** Real protocols combine both — asymmetric cryptography (RSA or Diffie-Hellman) safely establishes a shared secret, then fast symmetric encryption (AES) protects the actual data. This hybrid model powers HTTPS, SSH, and VPNs.

---

## Common Algorithms

Each algorithm has a clear purpose. Knowing which are secure and which are deprecated is essential for reading configurations and audit findings.

### Symmetric Algorithms

| Algorithm | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **DES** | Insecure — do not use. |
| **3DES** | Deprecated old upgrade. |
| **AES** | Industry standard for encrypting data. |
| **ChaCha20** | Modern, fast stream cipher. |

### Asymmetric Algorithms

| Algorithm | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **RSA** | Public-key encryption; based on prime factorization. |
| **Diffie-Hellman** | Secure key exchange; based on the discrete logarithm problem. |
| **ECDHE** | Modern TLS key exchange (ephemeral, elliptic curve). |
| **ECC** | Efficient public-key cryptography — smaller keys, same security. |

> **Security relevance:** RSA encrypts small secrets and signs data, Diffie-Hellman generates a shared secret without transmitting it, and AES encrypts the bulk data afterward because it is far faster. RSA and ECC solve a different problem from AES — never treat them as interchangeable.

---

## Encryption Cycle

The end-to-end flow shows where symmetric and asymmetric keys fit, from plaintext on the sender's side to plaintext on the receiver's side.

```
                Plaintext
                     |
                     v
             Encryption Algorithm
                     |
          +----------+----------+
          |                     |
          v                     v
    Symmetric Key         Public Key
          |                     |
          v                     v
               Ciphertext
                     |
              Internet/Network
                     |
                     v
             Decryption Algorithm
                     |
          +----------+----------+
          |                     |
          v                     v
    Same Secret Key       Private Key
          |
          v
                 Plaintext
```

> **Security relevance:** The ciphertext travels across an untrusted network, so its confidentiality rests entirely on key secrecy. Symmetric decryption needs the same secret key; asymmetric decryption needs the matching private key.

---

## Hashing

Hashing is fundamentally different from encryption: it is a one-way function producing a fixed-size digest, ideal for integrity checks and password storage. It cannot be reversed.

### Hash Functions

| Algorithm | Length | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **MD5** | 128 bits | Broken. |
| **SHA-1** | 160 bits | Broken. |
| **SHA-256** | 256 bits | Secure. |
| **SHA-512** | 512 bits | Secure. |

### Password Hashing Algorithms

Password storage uses deliberately slow, salted algorithms to resist brute-force and rainbow-table attacks.

| Algorithm | Note |
|-----------|------|
| **bcrypt** | Slow, salted; prefix `$2a$` / `$2b$`. |
| **scrypt** | Memory-hard password hashing. |
| **Argon2id** | Modern recommended password hash. |
| **PBKDF2** | Iterated key-derivation function. |

### Hash Recognition

Prefixes, lengths, and context help identify which algorithm produced a hash.

| Prefix / Context | Algorithm |
|------------------|-----------|
| **`$1$`** | MD5 crypt. |
| **`$2a$` / `$2b$`** | bcrypt. |
| **`$6$`** | SHA-512 crypt (Linux `/etc/shadow`). |
| **`$argon2id$`** | Argon2id. |
| **32 hex chars** | Likely MD5. |
| **40 hex chars** | Likely SHA-1. |
| **64 hex chars** | Likely SHA-256. |

Where hashes live on each platform, plus related helpers:

```text
Linux    -> /etc/shadow
Windows  -> SAM / NTLM
Integrity -> sha256sum
Auth     -> HMAC (hash + secret key)
Encoding -> Base64 (NOT encryption)
```

> **Security relevance:** MD5 and SHA-1 are broken and must not secure new systems. Passwords should never be stored with plain hashes — always use a slow, salted password hash like Argon2id or bcrypt. Base64 is encoding, not encryption, and provides no protection.

---

## Digital Signatures And PKI

Asymmetric cryptography also proves who sent data and binds identities to keys. Signatures give integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation; certificates and PKI establish trust on the Internet.

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Digital Signature** | Proves authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation. |
| **Signing Key** | The **private key** creates the signature. |
| **Verifying Key** | The **public key** verifies the signature. |
| **Certificate** | Binds an identity to a public key. |
| **Certificate Authority (CA)** | Trusted organization that issues and signs certificates. |
| **PKI** | Public Key Infrastructure — framework managing keys, certificates, and trust. |

### Email And File Security

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **PGP** | Original software for secure email. |
| **GPG** | Free, open-source implementation of the OpenPGP standard. |

> **Security relevance:** A signature made with a private key and verified with the matching public key is what lets a recipient trust a sender or a software release. Certificates and CAs extend that trust to strangers on the Internet, which is why a leaked private key is catastrophic — it enables both decryption and impersonation.

---

## OpenSSL And GPG Quick Reference

OpenSSL and GPG are the everyday command-line tools for keys, certificates, hashing, and encrypted email or files.

```bash
# Generate an RSA private key and matching public key
openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key

# Inspect a certificate
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout

# Hash a file for integrity
sha256sum file.iso
openssl dgst -sha256 file.iso

# GPG: generate a key pair, encrypt and decrypt
gpg --full-generate-key
gpg --encrypt --recipient user@example.com file.txt
gpg --decrypt file.txt.gpg
```

> **Security relevance:** These tools let you create the keys and certificates that underpin TLS and SSH, and verify downloaded files against a published hash. Handle generated private keys carefully — anyone who obtains one can decrypt or impersonate.

---

## SSH Keys

SSH uses asymmetric cryptography for authentication and symmetric encryption for the session itself. The key pair and its supporting files are worth memorizing.

```bash
# Generate an SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

# Copy the public key to a server
ssh-copy-id user@host
```

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| **`id_rsa` / `id_ed25519`** | Private key (keep secret). |
| **`.pub`** | Public key (shareable). |
| **`authorized_keys`** | Public keys allowed to log in to a host. |
| **`known_hosts`** | Server public keys the client has trusted. |

> **Security relevance:** SSH authentication proves identity without ever sending a password over the wire. The private key must stay protected — commonly with a passphrase — because it is the sole credential that grants access.

---

## John The Ripper Commands

John the Ripper performs offline password recovery: it generates candidate passwords, hashes them with the right algorithm, and compares against stored hashes. Offline cracking is fast because there is no network delay or account lockout.

### Core Commands

```bash
john                                        # check version
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash.txt        # dictionary attack
john --format=raw-md5 hash.txt              # specify hash format
john --single hashes.txt                    # single crack mode (uses usernames)
john --rules --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash.txt # mutate words with rules
john --incremental hashes.txt               # brute force when all else fails
john --restore                              # resume an interrupted session
john --show hash.txt                        # display recovered passwords
```

### Attack Modes

| Mode | Flag | When To Use |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Dictionary** | `--wordlist=` | First try, using a wordlist like `rockyou.txt`. |
| **Single Crack** | `--single` | Guesses from usernames and GECOS info. |
| **Rules** | `--rules` | Mutates words (numbers, symbols, capitalization). |
| **Incremental** | `--incremental` | Pure brute force when everything else fails. |

> **Security relevance:** Offline cracking bypasses lockouts entirely, which is why weak passwords fall quickly. This makes John a core tool for authorized password auditing — and a reminder to enforce strong, unique passwords and slow hashing.

---

## John Helper Tools

John cannot attack archives, SSH keys, or Linux hashes directly — helper tools first extract a crackable hash. Never attempt to crack the archive itself.

```bash
zip2john file.zip > zip.hash        # extract hash from a ZIP archive
rar2john file.rar > rar.hash        # extract hash from a RAR archive
ssh2john id_rsa > ssh.hash          # extract passphrase hash from SSH key
unshadow passwd shadow > hashes.txt # merge /etc/passwd + /etc/shadow
```

| Tool | Source | Produces |
|------|--------|----------|
| **zip2john** | ZIP archive | Hash John can attack. |
| **rar2john** | RAR archive | Hash John can attack. |
| **ssh2john** | SSH private key | Passphrase hash (attacks the passphrase, not the key). |
| **unshadow** | `/etc/passwd` + `/etc/shadow` | Combined file John can read. |

### Password-Cracking Workflow

```
Wordlist
   |
   v
Rules  ->  Mutated Passwords
   |
   v
 John  ->  hash comparison
   |
   v
Recovered Password  ->  john --show
```

> **Security relevance:** `unshadow` combines the username file with the hash file because John needs both. `ssh2john` attacks the passphrase protecting a private key, not the key itself. Keeping original hash files unchanged and choosing the correct format are what make the workflow reliable.

---

## John vs Hashcat

Both are offline cracking tools; the practical difference is hardware focus. John is optimized for the CPU with broad format support and ease of use, while Hashcat is optimized for GPU-accelerated recovery on large keyspaces.

```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt rockyou.txt   # GPU dictionary attack, MD5
```

> **Security relevance:** GPU acceleration in Hashcat can try billions of candidates per second, which is exactly why fast hashes like MD5 are unsuitable for passwords and slow, salted hashes are mandatory.

## Quick Revision

| Concept | Recall |
|---------|--------|
| Symmetric standard | AES |
| Asymmetric encryption | RSA (prime factorization) |
| Key exchange | Diffie-Hellman (shared secret) |
| Signature keys | Private signs, public verifies |
| Broken hashes | MD5 (128-bit), SHA-1 (160-bit) |
| Secure hashes | SHA-256, SHA-512 |
| Password hashes | Argon2id, bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2 |
| bcrypt prefix | `$2a$` / `$2b$` |
| Linux hashes | `/etc/shadow` (`$6$` = SHA-512) |
| Windows hashes | SAM / NTLM |
| First John attempt | `john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash.txt` |
| Show cracked | `john --show hash.txt` |
| Archive helpers | `zip2john`, `rar2john`, `ssh2john`, `unshadow` |

**Key idea:** Cryptography protects data three ways — encryption for confidentiality, hashing for integrity and password storage, and signatures for authenticity — and the same math that secures it (slow, salted hashing) is what makes weak passwords fall to tools like John.

## 30-Second Revision

- Encryption is reversible with a key; hashing is one-way and fixed-length. Encoding (Base64) is neither and provides no protection.
- Symmetric (AES, ChaCha20) is fast for bulk data; asymmetric (RSA, Diffie-Hellman, ECC) handles key exchange, signatures, and identity.
- DES and 3DES are dead; AES is the standard. RSA encrypts small secrets and signs, Diffie-Hellman shares a secret, AES then encrypts the data.
- MD5 (128-bit) and SHA-1 (160-bit) are broken; SHA-256 and SHA-512 are secure. Passwords need slow, salted hashes: Argon2id, bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2.
- Recognize hashes by prefix and length: `$2a$` bcrypt, `$6$` SHA-512 crypt, 32 hex MD5, 64 hex SHA-256.
- Digital signatures use the private key to sign and the public key to verify, giving integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation; PKI and CAs bind identities to keys.
- John cracks hashes offline with dictionary, single, rules, and incremental modes; helper tools `zip2john`, `rar2john`, `ssh2john`, and `unshadow` extract crackable hashes first.

## Interview Questions

**Q1. What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?**
Symmetric encryption uses a single shared secret key and is fast, so it encrypts bulk data (AES, ChaCha20). Asymmetric encryption uses a public/private key pair and is slower, so it handles key exchange, digital signatures, and identity (RSA, Diffie-Hellman, ECC). Real protocols combine both.

**Q2. How is hashing different from encryption?**
Encryption is a two-way process reversible with a key, protecting confidentiality. Hashing is a one-way function producing a fixed-size digest that cannot be reversed, used for integrity checks and password storage. Base64, by contrast, is only encoding and offers no security.

**Q3. Which key creates a digital signature, and which verifies it?**
The private key creates the signature and the corresponding public key verifies it. This provides authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation, since only the holder of the private key could have produced the signature.

**Q4. Why should passwords be stored with algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2id instead of MD5?**
MD5 is broken and extremely fast, so GPU-accelerated tools can try billions of guesses per second. bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2id, and PBKDF2 are deliberately slow and salted, which defeats rainbow tables and dramatically slows brute-force attacks.

**Q5. What does `unshadow` do and why is it needed for John the Ripper?**
`unshadow` merges `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` into a single combined file. John needs both the username information from `passwd` and the password hashes from `shadow` in one format before it can attempt to crack Linux account passwords.

## Final Takeaway

The Mystery Chest is your one-page memory aid for the Cryptography module. Skim it before any lab, exam, or interview: the core terms, the symmetric-versus-asymmetric split, the algorithm and hash tables with their prefixes and lengths, the signature and PKI concepts, and the OpenSSL, GPG, and John the Ripper references here cover the vast majority of what you will meet. Because cryptography reduces to three jobs — confidentiality through encryption, integrity and password storage through hashing, and authenticity through signatures — mastering how the algorithms, hashes, and tools fit together is what lets you protect data and audit its weaknesses with confidence.
