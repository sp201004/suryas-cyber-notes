## Objective

This room teaches one of the most important skills in Cyber Security: **searching**.

Cybersecurity professionals spend a significant amount of their time searching for information. Knowing **how** to search is often more valuable than memorizing every tool.

You will learn how to use:

- Shodan
- VirusTotal
- CVE Databases
- Linux MAN Pages
- GitHub

These resources are used daily by:

-  Penetration Testers
-  SOC Analysts
-  Incident Responders
-  Threat Hunters
-  Malware Analysts
-  Security Researchers

---

## Task 1 — Introduction

Cybersecurity is **not** about memorizing tools. Instead, professionals know:

-  Where information exists
-  How to search
-  Which website contains the answer

This room introduces websites that help security professionals collect intelligence during investigations. These services are useful for **both** Offensive Security and Defensive Security.

### Why Search Skills Matter

Imagine you discover:

- Unknown IP Address
- Strange File
- Weird Domain
- Open Port
- Unknown Software Version

What do you do? You **search**. Professional investigators rarely guess — instead they gather intelligence.

### Real Example

A SOC Analyst notices an IP address `185.243.xxx.xxx`. Instead of guessing, they investigate it through trusted sources:

```
IP Address
   │
   ▼
VirusTotal
   │
   ▼
Shodan
   │
   ▼
AbuseIPDB
   │
   ▼
WHOIS
   │
   ▼
CVE Database
   │
   ▼
Determine if malicious
```

### Information Gathering Workflow

```
Unknown Target
      │
      ▼
Collect Information
      │
      ▼
Identify Technology
      │
      ▼
Search Vulnerabilities
      │
      ▼
Find Exploits
      │
      ▼
Perform Investigation
```

> **Remember:** Searching is a cybersecurity skill. Good investigators don't know everything — they know where to find everything.

---

## Task 2 — Shodan

### What is Shodan?

**Shodan** is a search engine that indexes devices connected to the Internet.

Unlike Google, which searches **content**, Shodan searches **devices**.

**Google searches:**

- Websites
- Images
- Videos
- Documents

**Shodan searches:**

- Servers
- Routers
- Firewalls
- CCTV Cameras
- Databases
- IoT Devices
- Printers
- NAS Devices
- Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
- Smart Devices

> **Memory Trick:** Google searches **CONTENT** — Shodan searches **DEVICES**.

### What is IoT?

**IoT = Internet of Things** — physical devices connected to the Internet that communicate without human interaction.

Examples: Smart TV, Smart Camera, Smart Watch, Smart Door Lock, Smart Thermostat, Smart Light, Industrial Sensors.

### How Shodan Works

Instead of waiting for websites to appear, Shodan actively scans the Internet:

```
Internet
     │
     ▼
Shodan Scanner
     │
     ▼
Visits Every Public IP
     │
     ▼
Reads Open Ports
     │
     ▼
Collects Banners
     │
     ▼
Stores Information
```

### What is Banner Grabbing?

Whenever a service responds, it often reveals information. Example:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Apache/2.4.57
Ubuntu
OpenSSL 3.0
```

This information is called a **banner**. A banner tells us:

-  Software Name
-  Version
-  Operating System
-  Protocol
-  Server Type

### Example Banner

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache/2.4.1
Content-Type: text/html
Date: Mon, 01 Jul
```

From this banner we learn:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Web Server | Apache |
| Version | 2.4.1 |

### Why Version Numbers Matter

Suppose **Apache 2.4.1** has a vulnerability. If Shodan finds **Apache 2.4.1**, the attacker immediately knows it is a **potential target**.

### Real Attack Workflow

```
Search
   │
   ▼
Apache 2.4.1
   │
   ▼
Thousands of Servers
   │
   ▼
Search CVE Database
   │
   ▼
Known Vulnerability
   │
   ▼
Possible Exploitation
```

### Common Uses of Shodan

| Blue Team | Red Team |
|-----------|----------|
| Asset Discovery | Reconnaissance |
| Exposure Monitoring | Fingerprinting |
| Detect Open Services | Enumeration |
| Verify Public Systems | Technology Detection |
| Threat Intelligence | Target Selection |

### Common Shodan Filters

| Filter | Purpose | Examples |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `country:` | Limit search to a country | `country:IN`, `country:US`, `country:JP` |
| `port:` | Search by port | `port:22` (SSH), `port:80` (HTTP), `port:443` (HTTPS), `port:3389` (Remote Desktop) |
| `hostname:` | Search a specific hostname | `hostname:tryhackme.com` |
| `org:` | Devices owned by an organization | `org:Amazon`, `org:Google`, `org:Microsoft` |

### Practical Exercise — TryScanMe

In this task, TryHackMe introduces a machine named **TryScanMe**. Your objective is to use **Shodan** to investigate the target and identify information about the exposed services.

Instead of scanning the machine yourself, you search Shodan's database because it has already indexed the target.

### Searching a Domain

Open <https://www.shodan.io> and search for `tryhackme.thm`. Shodan will display information collected during its Internet-wide scan.

Example information you may find:

-  IP Address
-  Open Ports
-  Running Services
-  Web Server
-  Hostname
-  Organization
-  Operating System (sometimes)
-  Geographic Location

### Understanding the Results

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Hostname | tryhackme.thm |
| IP Address | 10.x.x.x (Lab Example) |
| Open Ports | 22, 80, 443 |

The open ports mean:

| Port | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 22 | SSH Remote Login |
| 80 | HTTP Website |
| 443 | HTTPS Secure Website |

### Attack Surface

Every exposed service increases the attack surface:

```
Internet
   │
   ▼
Target Server
 ├── SSH   (22)
 ├── HTTP  (80)
 └── HTTPS (443)
```

Each service should be reviewed for:

-  Weak Passwords
-  Vulnerabilities
-  Misconfiguration
-  Outdated Versions

### Shodan Search Examples

| Goal | Query |
|------|-------|
| Search Apache Servers | `apache` |
| Search Apache in India | `apache country:IN` |
| Search SSH Servers | `port:22` |
| Search Web Servers | `port:80` |
| Search HTTPS Servers | `port:443` |
| Search Microsoft Devices | `org:Microsoft` |
| Search Amazon Devices | `org:Amazon` |
| Search Cameras | `webcam` |
| Search NAS Devices | `nas` |
| Search Elasticsearch Servers | `product:Elasticsearch` |
| Search Jenkins Servers | `product:Jenkins` |

> **Important Note:** Shodan is intended for security research, asset discovery, exposure monitoring, and defensive assessments. **Never** use information obtained from Shodan to attack systems without explicit authorization. Only perform testing against TryHackMe, Hack The Box, your own systems, or authorized environments.

### Advantages of Shodan

-  Extremely Fast
-  No Need to Scan Yourself
-  Global Internet Visibility
-  Historical Data
-  Excellent OSINT Source

### Limitations

-  Results may not be real-time
-  Some devices block scanning
-  Internal/private networks cannot be indexed
-  Missing information if ports are closed

---

## Real-World Example — Shodan

Imagine a company accidentally exposes a server running **Apache 2.4.49**:

```
Apache 2.4.49 exposed
        │
        ▼
Attacker searches "Apache 2.4.49"
        │
        ▼
Thousands of vulnerable servers appear
        │
        ▼
Attacker checks CVE Database
        │
        ▼
Finds CVE-2021-41773
        │
        ▼
Downloads Public Exploit
        │
        ▼
Attempts exploitation
```

This demonstrates why organizations should continuously monitor their Internet-facing assets.

## Task 3 — VirusTotal

### What is VirusTotal?

**VirusTotal** is a free online threat intelligence platform that analyzes suspicious files, URLs, domains, and IP addresses using multiple antivirus engines and security vendors.

Instead of relying on a single antivirus, VirusTotal compares results from dozens of security products simultaneously.

Website: <https://www.virustotal.com>

### Why Security Professionals Use VirusTotal

VirusTotal helps answer questions like:

-  Is this file malicious?
-  Has anyone seen this malware before?
-  Which antivirus vendors detect it?
-  Is this URL phishing?
-  Is this IP involved in attacks?
-  What relationships exist between files and domains?

### Supported Search Types

VirusTotal can analyze **Files, URLs, Domains, IP Addresses,** and **File Hashes**.

### What is a File Hash?

A **hash** is a unique digital fingerprint generated from a file. Even changing ONE character in a file completely changes its hash:

```
File
   │
   ▼
malware.exe
   │
   ▼
SHA256
   │
   ▼
A4C9E8F21F5A......
```

Hashes help identify files without sharing the file itself.

### Common Hash Algorithms

| Algorithm | Size | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| MD5 | 128-bit | Fast; no longer secure for cryptographic purposes |
| SHA1 | 160-bit | Better than MD5; also considered weak today |
| SHA256 | 256-bit | Industry standard; most commonly used in cybersecurity |

> **Memory Trick:** MD5 = Old · SHA1 = Older · SHA256 = Modern.

### VirusTotal Scan Process

```
Upload File
     │
     ▼
Calculate Hash
     │
     ▼
Compare Existing Database
     │
     ▼
Scan with Multiple Antivirus Engines
     │
     ▼
Generate Report
```

### Detection Ratio

A detection ratio such as **52 / 70** means 52 security vendors detected the file as malicious, while 18 vendors did **not** detect it. A higher detection ratio means higher confidence that the file is malicious.

### Community Intelligence

VirusTotal also contains user comments, security research, community votes, and threat labels such as **Trojan, Ransomware, Spyware, Downloader,** and **Backdoor**.

### Relationships

VirusTotal links related objects together to help analysts investigate attacks:

```
Malware
   │
   ├── Domain
   ├── IP Address
   ├── URL
   ├── Certificate
   └── Other Malware Samples
```

---

## Real-World Example — VirusTotal

A SOC Analyst receives a file named `invoice.pdf.exe`, which looks suspicious:

```
invoice.pdf.exe (suspicious)
        │
        ▼
Upload to VirusTotal
        │
        ▼
Detection Ratio: 65 / 71
        │
        ▼
Threat Label: Trojan
        │
        ▼
Analyst isolates infected computer
        │
        ▼
Incident Response begins
```

---

## Blue Team Workflow

```

Read Detection Report
      │
      ▼
Confirm Threat
      │
      ▼
Contain Incident
```

## Task 4 — Vulnerability Databases

### What is a Vulnerability?

A **vulnerability** is a weakness in software, hardware, or system configuration that can be exploited by an attacker. Examples: weak password, software bug, missing patch, misconfiguration.

### What is CVE?

**CVE = Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures** — a globally recognized catalog of publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities. Every published vulnerability receives a unique identifier.

Example: `CVE-2024-3094`

| Part | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| CVE | Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures |
| 2024 | Year Published |
| 3094 | Unique ID |

### MITRE

**MITRE** maintains the official CVE program. Responsibilities:

-  Assign CVE IDs
-  Publish vulnerability details
-  Coordinate researchers
-  Maintain vulnerability records

### National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

The **NVD** is maintained by **NIST**. It expands CVE information by adding severity score, CVSS metrics, references, patch information, and technical details.

Website: <https://nvd.nist.gov>

### CVSS

**CVSS = Common Vulnerability Scoring System**, used to measure the severity of vulnerabilities on a scale from **0.0 to 10.0**:

| CVSS Score | Severity |
|------------|----------|
| 0.0 | None |
| 1.0 – 3.9 | Low |
| 4.0 – 6.9 | Medium |
| 7.0 – 8.9 | High |
| 9.0 – 10.0 | Critical |

### CVE Lifecycle

```
Software Bug
      │
      ▼
Researcher Finds Bug
      │
      ▼
MITRE Assigns CVE
      │
      ▼
NVD Publishes Details
      │
      ▼
Organizations Patch Systems
```

---

## Task 5 — Technical Documentation

### Why Technical Documentation Matters

One of the most underrated cybersecurity skills is the ability to read and understand official documentation. Experienced professionals rarely memorize every command or option — instead, they know where to find reliable documentation quickly.

Common sources:

-  Linux MAN Pages
-  Official Vendor Documentation
-  GitHub Documentation
-  Tool Help Menus
-  RFCs (Request for Comments)

### Linux MAN Pages

**MAN = Manual Pages.** Linux systems include built-in manuals for most commands.

```
man <command>
```

Example: `man ls` opens the complete documentation for the `ls` command.

Running `man grep` provides:

-  Description
-  Syntax
-  Options
-  Examples
-  Exit Status
-  Related Commands

### Structure of a MAN Page

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| NAME | Command Name |
| SYNOPSIS | Command Syntax |
| DESCRIPTION | What the command does |
| OPTIONS | Available Arguments |
| EXAMPLES | Usage Examples |
| SEE ALSO | Related Commands |

### Useful Navigation Keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Next Page |
| `b` | Previous Page |
| `/` | Search Text |
| `n` | Next Match |
| `q` | Quit |

### The --help Option

Most Linux commands support `--help`, for example `ls --help`, `grep --help`, `curl --help`. This displays a quick summary of available options.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `man` | Detailed Documentation |
| `--help` | Quick Reference |

> **Real-World Example:** Suppose you forget the options for `find`. Instead of searching Google, run `man find` or `find --help` — this saves time and provides official documentation.

---

## Task 6 — GitHub

### What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a platform for hosting software projects using Git. It allows developers and security researchers to collaborate, share code, report issues, and publish documentation.

Website: <https://github.com>

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Git | Version Control System |
| GitHub | Cloud platform that hosts Git repositories |

### Repository

A **Repository (Repo)** stores source code, documentation, images, configuration files, releases, issues, and a wiki.

### Why Cybersecurity Professionals Use GitHub

-  Open Source Security Tools
-  Exploit Proof-of-Concept (PoC)
-  Detection Rules
-  YARA Rules
-  Sigma Rules
-  Scripts & Automation
-  Security Research

### Common Cybersecurity Projects

Nmap · Metasploit · OWASP Projects · Sigma Rules · Awesome Lists · Threat Intelligence · Blue Team Scripts · Red Team Tools

### Searching GitHub

Example searches: `"CVE-2024"`, `"Apache Exploit"`, `"Log4Shell"`, `"Detection Rules"`, `"YARA"`, `"Suricata"`.

> **Important Warning:** Never execute random GitHub scripts without understanding their functionality. Always read the README, review the code, verify the author, test in a lab, and use virtual machines.
