# Overview
Operating System (OS) Security focuses on protecting an operating system from unauthorized access, attacks, malware, and data loss.

The Operating System acts as a bridge between:

- Hardware
- Applications
- Users

Without an OS, software cannot communicate with computer hardware.

# Why Operating System Security Matters
Your OS stores:

- Personal files
- Photos
- Videos
- Emails
- Passwords
- Banking information
- Office documents
- University work

If compromised:

- Data can be stolen
- Files can be modified
- Files can be deleted
- System can become unusable

# CIA Triad
The three pillars of Cyber Security

```
          Confidentiality
                ▲
               / \
              /   \
             /     \
Integrity -------- Availability
```

---

## 1. Confidentiality
Meaning

Only authorized people should access data.

Examples

 Password Protected Files

 Bank Accounts

 Medical Records

 Company Documents

Attack Examples

- Password Theft
- Data Leakage
- Spyware

---

## 2. Integrity
Meaning

Data should never be modified without authorization.

Examples

Changing

```
Salary = ₹50000

↓

Salary = ₹5
```

Integrity has been broken.

Attack Examples

- File Modification
- Database Tampering
- Malware

---

## 3. Availability
Meaning

Systems should always remain available.

Examples

- Websites
- Banking Apps
- Email
- Hospital Systems

Attack Examples

- Ransomware
- DDoS Attack
- Disk Failure

---

# Common Security Weaknesses
1. Weak Passwords

2. Weak File Permissions

3. Malware

---

# Authentication
Authentication means verifying your identity.

There are three factors.

---

## Something You Know
Examples

- Password
- PIN
- Passphrase

---

## Something You Have
Examples

- Phone
- Smart Card
- OTP Token
- Security Key

---

## Something You Are
Examples

- Fingerprint
- Face Recognition
- Retina Scan

---

# Weak Passwords
Weak passwords are easy to guess.

Common Examples

```
123456
123456789
qwerty
password
111111
12345678
abc123
1234567
password1
12345
1234567890
123123
000000
iloveyou
1234
1q2w3e4r5t
qwertyuiop
123
monkey
dragon
```

These passwords appear in dictionary attacks and leaked password databases.

---

# Strong Password Rules
Use

 Uppercase Letters

 Lowercase Letters

 Numbers

 Symbols

Minimum

12–16 Characters

Example

```
LearnM00r
```

Avoid

- Birthdays
- Phone Numbers
- Names
- Keyboard Patterns

Example

Bad

```
qwerty
123456
dragon
```

Good

```
TryHack!2026
```

---

# Password Best Practices
 Use Different Passwords

 Use Password Manager

 Enable MFA

 Never Share Passwords

 Never Reuse Passwords

---

# Principle of Least Privilege
Definition

Users should receive only the permissions necessary to perform their work.

Never give Administrator or Root access unless required.

Benefits

- Better Security
- Less Damage
- Reduced Risk

---

# Weak File Permissions
Poor permissions allow attackers to

- Read Files
- Modify Files
- Delete Files

Weak permissions affect

 Confidentiality

 Integrity

---

# Malicious Programs (Malware)
Malware is software created to damage or control systems.

Types

---

## Virus
Attaches to files.

Needs user execution.

---

## Worm
Spreads automatically through networks.

---

## Trojan Horse
Looks legitimate.

Actually installs malicious code.

Example

Fake Game Installer

↓

Installs Backdoor

---

## Ransomware
Encrypts files.

Victim cannot access data.

Attacker demands ransom.

Targets

Availability

---

## Spyware
Secretly collects

- Passwords
- Browsing History
- Personal Data

Targets

Confidentiality

---

# Practical Attack Scenario
Goal

Gain unauthorized access to a Linux machine.

---

## Step 1
Start

AttackBox

+

Lab Machine

---

## Step 2
Open Terminal

---

## Step 3
Connect using SSH

Syntax

```bash
ssh username@IP
```

Example

```bash
ssh sammie@10.10.10.10
```

Password

```
dragon
```

First Connection

```
Are you sure you want to continue connecting?

yes
```

SSH stores the server fingerprint inside

```
known_hosts
```

---

# Important SSH Note
While typing passwords

Nothing appears.

No

```
*
```

No

```
•
```

No

Characters

This is normal.

---

# Verify Logged User
Command

```bash
whoami
```

Purpose

Displays current username.

```bash
sammie
```

---

# List Files
Command

```bash
ls
```

Purpose

Lists directory contents.

Example

```bash
country.txt
draft.md
icon.png
password.txt
profile.jpg
```

---

# Read File
Command

```bash
cat filename
```

Example

```bash
cat draft.md
```

Output

```
Reusing passwords means
your password becomes exposed
if another service is hacked.
```

---

# Command History
Command

```bash
history
```

Purpose

Displays previously executed commands.

Useful for

- Investigations
- Forensics
- Finding Mistakes
