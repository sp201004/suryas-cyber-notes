- Navigate Windows using CMD
- Move between directories
- View files and folders
- Show hidden files
- Search files without knowing their location
- Read file contents
- Gather system information
- Understand basic networking information

These commands are used daily by:

- SOC Analysts

- Help Desk Engineers

---

# Storyline
Day 2 of your internship.

Your supervisor now wants you to use a Windows machine instead of Linux.

Mission:

 Find files
 Navigate folders
 Read files
 Collect system information

Exactly what real analysts do every day.

---

# Windows Command Prompt (CMD)
CMD is Windows' built-in command line interface.

Instead of clicking folders, you type commands.

Example:

```cmd
dir
cd Desktop
whoami
hostname
systeminfo
ipconfig
```

---

# Why Cybersecurity Professionals Use CMD
GUI is easy.

But GUI cannot always show everything.

Attackers hide files.

Malware hides folders.

Analysts need complete visibility.

CMD provides:

- Faster navigation
- Better control
- Hidden file visibility
- Easy automation
- Script execution

---

# Windows File System
Windows stores data in drives.

Usually:

```text
C:\
```

Inside C drive:

```
C:\
│
├── Windows
├── Program Files
├── Users
├── ProgramData
└── Temp
```

Most user files are inside

```
C:\Users\<username>
```

Example

```
C:\Users\Administrator
```

---

# Current Working Directory
Current folder where CMD is working.

Example

```
C:\Users\Administrator>
```

Everything you do starts here.

---

# Command : cd
Meaning

```
Change Directory
```

Purpose

Move from one folder to another.

Syntax

```cmd
cd folder_name
```

Example

```cmd
cd Desktop
```

Result

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>
```

---

Go Back

```cmd
cd ..
```

Example

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>

↓

cd ..

↓

C:\Users\Administrator>
```

---

Go Directly to Drive

```cmd
C:
```

or

```cmd
D:
```

---

# Command : dir
Meaning

```
Directory Listing
```

Shows

- Files
- Folders
- Size
- Date
- Time

Syntax

```cmd
dir
```

Example

```cmd
C:\Users\Administrator>dir
```

Output

```
Desktop

Documents

Downloads

Music

Pictures

Videos
```

---

Understanding dir Output

```
<DIR>
```

means

Directory

Example

```
<DIR> Desktop
```

means

Desktop is a folder.

Files don't have

```
<DIR>
```

---

# Hidden Files
Windows hides many important folders.

Examples

```
AppData

ProgramData

.logs

.research
```

These are hidden by default.

To see hidden files

```cmd
dir /a
```

Option

```
/a
```

means

Show ALL files.

Including

- Hidden
- System
- Read-only

---

Example

```cmd
dir /a
```

Output

```
.logs

AppData

ProgramData
```

---

Why Hidden Files Matter

Attackers often hide

- Malware
- Backdoors
- Scripts
- Persistence files

SOC analysts always inspect hidden folders.

---

# Moving Through Directories
Example

```cmd
cd Documents
```

Current location

```
C:\Users\Administrator
```

After command

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Documents
```

Return

```cmd
cd ..
```

---

# Searching Files
Suppose

You know

```
task_brief.txt
```

But don't know where it is.

Instead of checking every folder

Use

```cmd
dir /s task_brief.txt
```

Meaning

```
/s
```

Search recursively.

Entire current directory tree.

---

Example

```cmd
dir /s task_brief.txt
```

Output

```
Directory of

C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Notes

task_brief.txt
```

Now you know exactly where it is.

---

# Reading Files
Windows command

```cmd
type filename
```

Example

```cmd
type task_brief.txt
```

Output

```
Welcome Analyst

Find the hostname

Find the Windows Version

Find the IP Address
```

Equivalent Linux command

```bash
cat task_brief.txt
```

---

# Workflow Used in This Room
Find file

↓

```cmd
dir /s task_brief.txt
```

↓

Navigate

```cmd
cd path
```

↓

Verify

```cmd
dir
```

↓

Read

```cmd
type task_brief.txt
```

---

# Real World Example
SOC receives alert

```
Suspicious Script Found
```

Only filename is known

```
payload.ps1
```

Analyst runs

```cmd
dir /s payload.ps1
```

Finds file

↓

Reads it

```cmd
type payload.ps1
```

↓

Starts investigation.

# System Information Commands
One of the first tasks during a penetration test or incident response is **enumeration**.

Enumeration means collecting as much information about the target system as possible.

Typical questions include:

- Who am I?
- Which computer is this?
- Which Windows version is installed?
- What is the hostname?
- What is the IP address?
- What hardware is available?

Windows provides built-in commands to answer these questions.

---

# Command : whoami

## Purpose
Displays the username of the currently logged-in account.

---

## Syntax
```cmd
whoami
```

---

## Example
```cmd
C:\Users\Administrator>whoami
```

Output

```text
desktop-01\administrator
```

---

## Why is it Important?
During penetration testing you must know

- Current user
- Privilege level
- Domain user
- Local account

Example

```
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

means highest privilege.

---

## Real World Usage
Before running privilege escalation tools

```cmd
whoami
```

Always verify

- Current account
- User context

---

# Command : hostname

## Purpose
Displays the computer name.

---

## Syntax
```cmd
hostname
```

---

## Example
```cmd
hostname
```

Output

```text
TryHackMe-PC
```

---

## Why Hostname Matters?
Helps identify

- Servers
- Workstations
- Domain Computers
- Virtual Machines

SOC analysts use hostnames to identify infected devices.

---

# Command : systeminfo

## Purpose
Displays complete operating system information.

Think of it as

```
About This PC

+

Hardware

+

Windows Version

+

```

all in one command.

---

## Syntax
```cmd
systeminfo
```

---

## Output Includes
```
Host Name

OS Name

OS Version

System Type

Processor

RAM

Domain

BIOS

Hotfixes

Boot Time

Network Adapter
```

---

## Example
```cmd

## Why Cybersecurity Uses systeminfo
Security professionals use it to

 Detect OS Version

 Find Patch Level

 Identify Vulnerabilities

 Match Exploits

 Verify Architecture

---

## Example
Suppose

Exploit only works on

```
Windows Server 2016
```

Run

```cmd
systeminfo
```

If output says

```
Windows Server 2019
```

Different exploit required.

---

# Command : ipconfig

## Purpose

# Windows vs Linux Commands
| Linux | Windows CMD | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| whoami | whoami | Current User |
| hostname | hostname | Computer Name |
| uname -a | systeminfo | OS Information |
| ip addr | ipconfig | Network Information |
| df -h | systeminfo | Storage/System Details |
| cat | type | Read File |
| ls | dir | List Files |
| pwd | cd | Current Directory |

---

### What does whoami do?
Displays the current logged-in user.

---

### Difference between hostname and whoami?
hostname → Computer Name

whoami → Current User

---

### What information does systeminfo provide?
Operating System, RAM, CPU, Architecture, Hotfixes, Boot Time, Domain, Network Adapter.

---

### Why use ipconfig?
To identify IP configuration including IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

---

### Difference between ipconfig and ipconfig /all?
| ipconfig | ipconfig /all |
|-----------|---------------|
| Basic network info | Complete adapter details |
| IP Address | IP + MAC + DNS + DHCP + Lease Info |

---

# Environment Variables
Environment Variables are predefined values that Windows uses to locate important files and folders.

Instead of typing the complete path

```
C:\Users\Administrator
```

Windows allows

```
%USERPROFILE%
```

---

## Common Environment Variables
| Variable | Points To |
|-----------|-----------|
| `%USERPROFILE%` | Current User Profile |
| `%USERNAME%` | Current Username |
| `%COMPUTERNAME%` | Computer Name |
| `%TEMP%` | Temporary Files |
| `%WINDIR%` | Windows Directory |
| `%SYSTEMROOT%` | Windows Installation Folder |
| `%APPDATA%` | Roaming Application Data |
| `%PROGRAMFILES%` | Installed Applications |

---

## Example
```cmd
echo %USERNAME%
```

Output

```text
Administrator
```

---

```cmd
echo %COMPUTERNAME%
```

Output

```text
TRYHACKME
```

---

```cmd
echo %USERPROFILE%
```

Output

```text
C:\Users\Administrator
```

---

# Why Environment Variables Matter
Cybersecurity professionals use them because

 Scripts become portable

 Malware often stores files in `%TEMP%`

 Attackers hide payloads in `%APPDATA%`

 Incident responders investigate these folders first

---

# Useful CMD Commands

---

## Why are hidden files important?
Attackers often store malware or persistence files inside hidden directories.

---

# Common Mistakes
 Using Administrator account for daily tasks.

 Use standard user whenever possible.

---

 Ignoring hidden files.

 Always inspect hidden directories.

---

 Forgetting environment variables.

 They simplify navigation and scripting.
