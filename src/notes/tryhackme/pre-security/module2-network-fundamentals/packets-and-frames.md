#### Learning Objectives
After completing this room you should understand:
- The difference between packets and frames
- What encapsulation is
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- The TCP Three-Way Handshake

#### Packets vs Frames
Data travels in different units depending on which OSI layer it is on.
- **Packets** — Data unit at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**. Contains logical IP addresses.
- **Frames** — Data unit at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**. Contains physical MAC addresses.

```text
[ Layer 3: Packet ]  <── Contains Source IP & Destination IP
        ↓  (Encapsulated into L2)
[ Layer 2: Frame  ]  <── Contains Source MAC & Destination MAC + Packet Data
```

#### Layer 4 Transport Protocols
When sending data over a network, Layer 4 must choose between two main protocols: **TCP** and **UDP**.

##### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **Connection-oriented** — Before sending data, a connection MUST be established between the sender and receiver.
- **Reliable** — Guarantees that all data is delivered safely and in the correct order. If a piece of data is lost, TCP will detect it and request retransmission.
- **Features:** Slow but reliable · Flow Control · Error checking.
- **Used for:** Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS) · Email (SMTP) · File Transfer (FTP) · Remote Terminal (SSH).

##### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- **Connectionless** — Does not establish a connection before sending data. It just sends the data and hopes it arrives (fire-and-forget).
- **Unreliable** — Does not guarantee that data will arrive or that it will be in the correct order. No retransmission if data is lost.
- **Features:** Fast · Low overhead · No error checking/retransmission.
- **Used for:** Video streaming · Online gaming · Voice over IP (VoIP) · DNS queries.

#### The TCP Three-Way Handshake
To establish a secure connection, TCP uses a three-step handshake:

```text
[ Client ] ────────── SYN ──────────> [ Server ]
[ Client ] <─────── SYN-ACK ───────── [ Server ]
[ Client ] ────────── ACK ──────────> [ Server ]
```

1. **SYN (Synchronize)** — The client sends a packet with a synchronize flag to initiate the connection. "Hello, I want to talk."
2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)** — The server replies with a synchronize and acknowledge flag. "I hear you, I am ready to talk."
3. **ACK (Acknowledge)** — The client sends an acknowledge packet. "Great, let's start sending data."

Once these three steps are complete, the connection is open, and data can be transmitted.

##### Handshake Steps
| Step | Sender | Packet Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Client | **SYN** | Requesting connection |
| **2** | Server | **SYN-ACK** | Ready, acknowledging request |
| **3** | Client | **ACK** | Final handshake confirmation |

## Interview Questions

- **TCP vs UDP?**
  | Feature | TCP | UDP |
  |---|---|---|
  | Connection | Yes | No |
  | Reliability | Yes | No |
  | Speed | Slower | Faster |
- **What is the TCP 3-Way Handshake?** The process used to establish a reliable TCP session using three packets: **SYN**, **SYN-ACK**, and **ACK**.
- **When would you use UDP over TCP?** For real-time applications like online gaming, video streaming, or VoIP, where speed is more important than perfect data accuracy.
- **What is Encapsulation in networking?** The process of wrapping higher-layer data with headers (IP at L3, MAC at L2) as it travels down the OSI stack for transmission.

## Quick Revision

| Feature | TCP | UDP |
|---|---|---|
| **Connection** | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
| **Reliability** | Reliable | Unreliable |
| **Speed** | Slower | Faster |
| **Flow Control** | Yes | No |
| **Data Unit** | Segment | Datagram |
| **Common Uses** | Web, Email, SSH | Video, Gaming, DNS |

## Final Summary

- Packets belong to Layer 3 and use IP addresses; Frames belong to Layer 2 and use MAC addresses.
- Encapsulation builds the transmission unit step-by-step down the OSI stack.
- TCP is connection-oriented, performing a 3-way handshake to guarantee reliable delivery.
- UDP is connectionless and fast, prioritizing transmission speed over verification.
- The 3-way handshake consists of SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets.
