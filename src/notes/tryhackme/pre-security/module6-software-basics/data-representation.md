## Overview

Computers cannot understand human languages, words, images, colors, or numbers directly. Everything inside a computer is ultimately represented using only two states: 0 and 1.

These two values form the Binary Number System, which is the foundation of all modern computing. Every image, document, executable file, video, password, network packet, and even an operating system is stored as binary data.

Understanding how computers represent information is one of the most important concepts in Cybersecurity because security professionals constantly analyze binary and hexadecimal data. Examples include: Memory Dumps, Network Packets, Malware Files, Password Hashes, Hex Editors, File Signatures, and Digital Forensics.

## What is Data Representation?

Data Representation is the process of storing and representing information inside a computer using binary digits. Humans understand: Letters, Numbers, Images, Videos, Audio, and Colors. Computers understand only 0 and 1. Everything must eventually become binary.

**Example:**
```text
Character:  A
↓
ASCII:      65
↓
Binary:     01000001
```

---

## Why Computers Use Binary

Electronic devices are built using billions of tiny switches called Transistors. A transistor has only two stable states: ON or OFF (HIGH Voltage or LOW Voltage).

These become:
```text
ON  → 1
OFF → 0
```

### ASCII Diagram

```text
Switch

OFF ------------> 0
ON -------------> 1
```

Modern CPUs contain billions of these switches. Everything is processed using combinations of these binary states.

---

## Real World Example

Imagine a light bulb.
```text
Bulb ON   → 1
Bulb OFF  → 0
```

Now imagine three bulbs: Red, Green, and Blue. Each bulb has two states: ON or OFF.
Possible combinations:
```text
000
001
010
011
100
101
110
111
```
Total combinations: `2 × 2 × 2 = 8`. This is exactly how the first computer color systems worked.

---

## Number Systems

| Number System | Base | Symbols | Used By |
|---|---|---|---|
| Binary | 2 | 0 1 | Computers |
| Octal | 8 | 0–7 | Older systems |
| Decimal | 10 | 0–9 | Humans |
| Hexadecimal | 16 | 0–9 A–F | Programmers |

---

## Understanding Bases

The Base of a number system tells us how many unique symbols it contains.

| System | Symbols | After Last Symbol |
|---|---|---|
| **Decimal** | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 | After 9 comes 10 |
| **Binary** | 0 1 | After 1 comes 10 |
| **Hexadecimal** | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F | After F comes 10 |

---

## Decimal Number System

Humans naturally use Base-10.
**Example:** `572` actually means `5 × 10² + 7 × 10¹ + 2 × 10⁰`.
Expanded: `500 + 70 + 2 = 572`.

### ASCII Diagram

```text
572
│ │ │
│ │ └── 2 × 10⁰
│ └──── 7 × 10¹
└────── 5 × 10²
```

---

## Binary Number System

Binary contains only 0 and 1. Each position represents a power of two.
**Example:** `1011`
```text
1 × 2³ + 0 × 2² + 1 × 2¹ + 1 × 2⁰
8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11
```

**Position Table:**

| Bit | Value |
|---|---:|
| 2⁷ | 128 |
| 2⁶ | 64 |
| 2⁵ | 32 |
| 2⁴ | 16 |
| 2³ | 8 |
| 2² | 4 |
| 2¹ | 2 |
| 2⁰ | 1 |

**Memory Trick:**
```text
128   64   32   16   8   4   2   1
```
Remember this sequence forever. Every binary conversion becomes easy.

---

## What is a Bit?

A Bit (Binary Digit) is the smallest unit of data, with possible values of 0 or 1.
One Bit stores only two states. Examples: True/False, Yes/No, ON/OFF.

---

## What is a Nibble?

`4 Bits = 1 Nibble` (Example: `1010`)
Nibble is important because:
```text
One Hexadecimal Digit = One Nibble
```

---

## What is a Byte?

`8 Bits = 1 Byte` (Example: `10101010`)
One Byte stores 256 possible values because `2⁸ = 256`.

---

## Storage Units

| Unit | Size |
|---|---|
| 1 Bit | 0 or 1 |
| 1 Nibble | 4 Bits |
| 1 Byte | 8 Bits |
| 1 KB | 1024 Bytes |
| 1 MB | 1024 KB |
| 1 GB | 1024 MB |
| 1 TB | 1024 GB |

---

## Binary Counting

**Decimal:** `0 1 2 3 4 5`
**Binary:** `000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111`

**Notice:** Every digit doubles the possible combinations.
| Bits | Values | Formula |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Bit | 2 values | `2¹ = 2` |
| 2 Bits | 4 values | `2² = 4` |
| 3 Bits | 8 values | `2³ = 8` |
| 4 Bits | 16 values | `2⁴ = 16` |
| 8 Bits | 256 values | `2⁸ = 256` |

---

## Why Binary Matters in Cybersecurity

Binary appears everywhere in cybersecurity contexts:
- Packet Analysis
- Malware Analysis
- Reverse Engineering
- Digital Forensics
- Memory Dumps
- File Recovery
- Disk Analysis
- Password Hashes
- CPU Instructions
- Network Protocols

**Example:** Wireshark captures packets in Hexadecimal, but internally those bytes are binary. Hex Editors display binary files using hexadecimal because binary is too long for humans to read.

---

## Representing Colors

Computers do not understand colors like humans do. Instead, every color is created by combining three primary colors: Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B). This is known as the **RGB Color Model**. Every color displayed on your monitor, phone, or TV is generated using different intensities of these three colors.

---

## RGB Color Model

### ASCII Diagram

```text
          RED
           ▲
          / \
         /   \
        /     \
     BLUE --- GREEN
```

Each primary color has its own intensity value:
- Red: 0 - 255
- Green: 0 - 255
- Blue: 0 - 255

**Example:** `RGB(255,0,0)` produces Pure Red.

---

## Why 255?

Each color channel uses **8 bits**.
```text
8 Bits → 2⁸ → 256 Values → 0 to 255
```
So every RGB component can store 256 different intensity levels.

---

## Example RGB Values

| Color | RGB |
|---|---|
| Black | (0,0,0) |
| White | (255,255,255) |
| Red | (255,0,0) |
| Green | (0,255,0) |
| Blue | (0,0,255) |
| Yellow | (255,255,0) |
| Cyan | (0,255,255) |
| Magenta | (255,0,255) |

---

## Representing Only 8 Colors

Suppose each color only has 1 Bit.
Possible values: `0` or `1` (Meaning OFF or ON).
Available combinations: `000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111`.
Total: `2³ = 8 Colors`.

---

## Color Table

| Binary | Color |
|---|---|
| 000 | Black |
| 001 | Blue |
| 010 | Green |
| 011 | Cyan |
| 100 | Red |
| 101 | Magenta |
| 110 | Yellow |
| 111 | White |

### ASCII Diagram

```text
Red Green Blue
 0    0    0   → Black
 1    1    1   → White
```

---

## Modern Displays

Modern monitors don't use only 1 Bit; they use 8 Bits per color.
- Red → 256 Levels
- Green → 256 Levels
- Blue → 256 Levels

Total colors: `256 × 256 × 256 = 16,777,216 Colors`.
This is called 24-bit Color because `8 + 8 + 8 = 24 Bits`.

---

## 24-bit Color Layout

```text
+--------+--------+--------+
|  Red   | Green  |  Blue  |
| 8 Bits | 8 Bits | 8 Bits |
+--------+--------+--------+
```
Each pixel occupies 24 Bits = 3 Bytes.

---

## Binary Representation

Suppose:
- Red = 255 → `11111111`
- Green = 128 → `10000000`
- Blue = 64 → `01000000`

Entire color: `11111111 10000000 01000000`

---

## What is Hexadecimal?

Hexadecimal is a Base-16 Number System. Instead of 10 Digits, it uses 16 Symbols: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F`
Where: `A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14, F = 15`.

---

## Why Programmers Love Hex

Imagine one byte in Binary: `11111111`. It looks long.
In Hexadecimal, it is simply `FF`. Much shorter.

**Comparison:**

| Binary | Hex | Binary | Hex |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0000 | 0 | 1000 | 8 |
| 0001 | 1 | 1001 | 9 |
| 0010 | 2 | 1010 | A |
| 0011 | 3 | 1011 | B |
| 0100 | 4 | 1100 | C |
| 0101 | 5 | 1101 | D |
| 0110 | 6 | 1110 | E |
| 0111 | 7 | 1111 | F |

**Memory Trick:** Always remember that `4 Bits = 1 Hex Digit`.

---

## Hexadecimal Color Codes

Web developers usually write RGB colors as `#RRGGBB`.
**Example:** `#FF0000` means Red=FF, Green=00, Blue=00. Result: Pure Red.

---

## More Examples

| Color | Hex Code |
|---|---|
| White | `#FFFFFF` |
| Black | `#000000` |
| Green | `#00FF00` |
| Blue | `#0000FF` |
| Yellow | `#FFFF00` |
| Purple | `#FF00FF` |
| Cyan | `#00FFFF` |

---

## Binary → Hex Conversion

**Example:** `11001010`
1. Split into groups of four bits: `1100` and `1010`.
2. Convert individually: `1100 → C` and `1010 → A`.
3. Answer: `CA`.

### ASCII Diagram

```text
11001010
   ↓
1100 1010
   ↓
 C     A
   ↓
   CA
```

---

## Hex → Binary

**Example:** `3F`
1. Convert each digit separately.
2. `3 → 0011` and `F → 1111`.
3. Answer: `00111111`.

---

## Where is Hex Used?

Cybersecurity professionals use Hexadecimal almost every day.
Examples: Wireshark, Hex Editors, Reverse Engineering, Malware Analysis, Digital Forensics, Packet Analysis, Memory Dumps, File Recovery, and File Signatures.

---

## Example

- PNG files always begin with `89 50 4E 47`
- JPEG files begin with `FF D8 FF`
- PDF files begin with `25 50 44 46`

These are called **Magic Numbers** or **File Signatures**. Analysts use these signatures to identify unknown files.

---

## Number Systems in Detail

In the previous sections, we learned that computers internally store everything in Binary, while humans naturally use Decimal. As a cybersecurity professional, you should be comfortable converting between:
- Decimal ↔ Binary
- Binary ↔ Hexadecimal
- Hexadecimal ↔ Decimal
- Binary ↔ Octal

These conversions are frequently encountered while analyzing Network Packets, Memory Dumps, Malware, Shellcode, Machine Instructions, File Signatures, and Cryptographic Data.

---

## Binary Place Values

Every binary digit (bit) represents a power of 2.

```text
Bit Position

128   64   32   16    8    4    2    1
 │     │    │    │    │    │    │    │
 2⁷    2⁶   2⁵   2⁴   2³   2²   2¹   2⁰
```

Always memorize this table.

**Memory Trick:**
```text
128   64   32   16   8   4   2   1
```
If you remember these eight values, most binary conversions become very easy.

---

## Decimal → Binary

The easiest method is repeated division by 2.

**Example:** Convert `13`
```text
13 ÷ 2 = 6  remainder 1
 6 ÷ 2 = 3  remainder 0
 3 ÷ 2 = 1  remainder 1
 1 ÷ 2 = 0  remainder 1
```
Now read remainders from bottom to top. Answer: `13₁₀ = 1101₂`.

---

## Another Example

**Example:** Convert `25`
```text
25 ÷ 2 = 12 remainder 1
12 ÷ 2 = 6  remainder 0
 6 ÷ 2 = 3  remainder 0
 3 ÷ 2 = 1  remainder 1
 1 ÷ 2 = 0  remainder 1
```
Read upwards. Answer: `25₁₀ = 11001₂`.

---

## Binary → Decimal

Multiply every bit with its corresponding power of two.

**Example:** `1101`
```text
1×8 + 1×4 + 0×2 + 1×1
8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13
```
Answer: `1101₂ = 13₁₀`.

---

## Example

**Example:** Convert `101101`
```text
32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 45
```
Answer: `101101₂ = 45₁₀`.

---

## Shortcut Method

Write the powers of two: `32 16 8 4 2 1`.
Binary: `1 0 1 1 0 1`.
Multiply: `32 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 45`.
Very useful during interviews.

---

## Binary ↔ Hexadecimal

Instead of converting the whole binary number, split it into groups of four bits.

**Example:** `11101010`
1. Split: `1110` and `1010`.
2. Convert individually: `1110 → E` and `1010 → A`.
3. Answer: `EA`.

---

## Another Example

**Example:** `10111100`
1. Split: `1011` and `1100`.
2. Convert: `1011 = B` and `1100 = C`.
3. Answer: `BC`.

---

## Hexadecimal → Binary

Each hexadecimal digit always represents four bits.

**Example:** `A` → `1010`
**Example:** `F` → `1111`
**Example:** `2A` → `0010` and `1010` → `00101010`

---

## Decimal → Hexadecimal

Divide repeatedly by 16.

**Example:** Convert `255`
`255 ÷ 16 = 15 remainder 15`.
15 → F. Remainder 15 → F.
Answer: `FF`.

---

## Example

**Example:** Convert `26`
`26 ÷ 16 = 1 remainder 10`.
`10 = A`.
Answer: `1A`.

---

## Hexadecimal → Decimal

**Example:** `2F`
`2 × 16 + 15 = 47`.
Answer: `2F₁₆ = 47₁₀`.

---

## Octal Number System

Octal uses Base-8.
Digits: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7`.
After `7` comes `10`.

---

## Why Octal Exists

Older computer systems grouped binary digits into sets of three bits.
```text
3 Bits → One Octal Digit
```
Today Octal is less common but still appears in Linux File Permissions, UNIX Systems, and Embedded Devices.
**Example:** `755` (Linux Permissions: `rwxr-xr-x`).

---

## Binary ↔ Octal

Split binary into groups of three.
**Example:** `110101`
1. Split: `110` and `101`.
2. Convert: `6` and `5`.
3. Answer: `65₈`.

---

## Practice Questions

**Convert to Binary:**
- `15 = 1111`
- `31 = 11111`
- `42 = 101010`
- `100 = 1100100`

**Convert to Decimal:**
- `10010 = 18`
- `11111 = 31`
- `101010 = 42`

**Convert to Hex:**
- `11111111 = FF`
- `10101010 = AA`
- `11001100 = CC`

- Computers understand only binary.
- Binary is based on powers of 2. Decimal is based on powers of 10.
- 1 Bit = Binary Digit. 4 Bits = 1 Nibble. 8 Bits = 1 Byte.
- Every file eventually becomes binary.
- Cybersecurity professionals constantly work with binary and hexadecimal data.
- RGB uses Red, Green and Blue. Each channel stores 8 Bits. Total colors = 16.7 Million.
- Hexadecimal uses Base-16. One Hex digit represents one Nibble.
- Hex is shorter and easier to read than Binary. File signatures and memory dumps are usually displayed in Hex.
- Learn binary conversions before moving to advanced topics.
- Understanding data representation is essential for networking, operating systems, malware analysis, and digital forensics.
