## Overview
Earlier computers worked independently. As technology evolved, systems started communicating over networks to share resources and services.

This communication follows the **Client-Server Model**, the foundation of the Internet.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Client-Server Architecture
- Understand Client
- Understand Server
- Understand Network
- Understand Service
- Understand Protocol
- Understand Port
- Understand DNS
- Understand HTTP
- Understand HTTP Request & Response

---

## What is Client-Server?
A Client requests a service.

A Server provides that service.

```
          Request
Client ----------------> Server
       <----------------
          Response
```

| Client | Server |
|---------|---------|
| Browser | Google |
| Phone App | Instagram Server |
| Chrome | GitHub |
| Outlook | Mail Server |

---

## Real Life Analogy (Pizza Shop)
Imagine ordering pizza.

```
You (Alice)
        ↓
Tell Bob your order
        ↓
Bob goes to Luigi's Pizza
        ↓
Luigi prepares pizza
        ↓
Bob returns pizza
```

**Computer Equivalent**

| Pizza Story | Networking |
|-------------|------------|
| Alice | Client |
| Luigi's Pizza | Server |
| Bob | Network Communication |
| Pizza Order | Request |
| Pizza | Response |

---

## Client
A client is a device or software that requests services from another computer.

**Examples**

- Browser
- Mobile App
- Laptop
- Desktop
- API Consumer

```
Chrome
Firefox
Edge
Safari
Postman
curl
```

---

## Server
A server is a computer that provides services to clients.

**Examples**

- Web Server
- Database Server
- File Server
- Mail Server
- DNS Server

Servers usually:

- Run 24×7
- Handle many users
- Store data
- Process requests

---

## Service
A service is something a server offers.

```
Website
Email
Database
Cloud Storage
Authentication
API
Downloads
Streaming
```

---

## Request
A request is sent by the client asking for a resource.

**Example**

```
GET /index.html
```

---

## Response
The server processes the request and sends back data.

**Example**

```
200 OK

HTML Page
Image
JSON
CSS
JavaScript
```

---

## Protocol
A protocol is a set of communication rules.

Without protocols computers cannot understand each other.

**A protocol defines**

- Language
- Message format
- Commands
- Responses
- Error handling

**Examples**

```
HTTP
HTTPS
FTP
SSH
DNS
SMTP
```

---

## Network
A network connects computers together.

**Examples**

```
LAN
WAN
Internet
```

---

## Port
A Port identifies a particular service running on a server.

> Think of one building having many doors. Each door leads to a different service.

```
Computer
│
├── Port 80
├── Port 443
├── Port 22
├── Port 21
└── Port 53
```

### Common Ports
| Port | Service |
|-------|----------|
| `20/21` | FTP |
| `22` | SSH |
| `23` | Telnet |
| `25` | SMTP |
| `53` | DNS |
| `80` | HTTP |
| `110` | POP3 |
| `143` | IMAP |
| `443` | HTTPS |
| `3389` | RDP |

---

## DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS converts human-readable names into IP addresses.

**Example**

```
google.com
↓
142.250.xxx.xxx
```

> Like GPS: Restaurant Name → Actual Address

Without DNS:

```
https://google.com
↓
142.250.xxx.xxx
```

---

## IP Address
Every computer on a network has an address.

**Example**

```
192.168.1.10
8.8.8.8
1.1.1.1
```

> IP is like a house address.

---

## HTTP
HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol

Used to transfer web pages.

**Default Port:** `80`

**Characteristics**

- Stateless
- Client-Server Protocol
- Request-Response Model

---

## HTTPS
HTTPS = HTTP + SSL/TLS Encryption

**Default Port:** `443`

**Advantages**

- Encryption
- Authentication
- Integrity

> Always prefer HTTPS.

---

## Stateless Protocol
HTTP is stateless.

**Meaning:** The server forgets previous requests.

```
Request 1
↓
Completed
↓
Server forgets
```

---

## How Websites Remember You
Modern websites use:

- Cookies
- Session IDs
- Tokens

```
Login
↓
Session Created
↓
Cookie Stored
↓
Next Request
↓
Cookie Sent
↓
User Recognized
```

---

## HTTP Methods

### GET
Retrieve data.

```
GET /index.html
```

Used for: Opening pages, Reading information

---

### POST
Create data.

```
POST /login
```

Used for: Login, Signup, Form Submission

---

### PUT
Replace existing resource.

---

### PATCH
Update part of a resource.

---

### DELETE
Delete a resource.

---

### HEAD
Retrieve headers only.

---

### OPTIONS

### What is Client-Server Architecture?
A communication model where clients request services and servers provide them.

---

### Difference between Client and Server?
| Client | Server |
|---------|---------|
| Requests | Responds |
| Starts Communication | Waits for Requests |
| Browser | Web Server |

---

### Why is DNS needed?
Humans remember names. Computers communicate using IP addresses. DNS converts names into IPs.

---

### What is a Port?
A logical communication endpoint used to identify services running on a computer.

---

### HTTP vs HTTPS
| HTTP | HTTPS |
|------|-------|
| Unencrypted | Encrypted |
| Port `80` | Port `443` |
| Less Secure | More Secure |

---

### What is Stateless?
Server does not remember previous requests.

---

### What are Cookies?
Small files stored in the browser to maintain sessions.

---

### What is a Session?
Temporary user information maintained after login.

## Memory Tricks

```
Client → Requests → Server → Responds
```

```
DNS: Name → IP
```

```
Port: Door of a Service
```

```
HTTP: Web Communication
HTTPS: Secure Web Communication
```

```
GET → Read
POST → Create
PUT → Replace
PATCH → Update
DELETE → Delete
```

## Quick Revision

 Client requests

 Server responds

 Protocol = Communication rules

 DNS = Name → IP

 Port = Service Identifier

 HTTP = Web Protocol

 HTTPS = Secure HTTP

 HTTP is Stateless

 Cookies maintain sessions
