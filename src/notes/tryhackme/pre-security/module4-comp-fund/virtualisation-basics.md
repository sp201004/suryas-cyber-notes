## Why Virtualization?
Before virtualization:

```
1 Physical Server
        │
        ▼
   1 Application

(One Server = One Application)
```

**Problems:**

- Expensive hardware
- High electricity cost
- Low resource utilization (5–20%)
- Difficult scaling
- Slow deployment
- Wasted CPU, RAM & Storage

**Example:**

```
Server 1 → Website
Server 2 → Database
Server 3 → Email
Server 4 → Internal App

= 4 Physical Servers
= High Cost
```

---

## What is Virtualization?
Virtualization allows **multiple virtual computers (VMs)** to run on a **single physical server**.

```
            Physical Server
                 │
              Hypervisor
        ┌────────┼────────┐
        │        │        │
      VM1      VM2      VM3
```

**Benefits**

- Better hardware utilization
- Lower cost
- Faster deployment
- Easy scaling
- Isolation
- Better security

---

### Why Virtualization Was Needed
**Old approach**

```
1 Server
      │
      ▼
1 Application
```

Problems: Expensive, Resource wastage, Hard to manage, Difficult upgrades

**New approach**

```
1 Powerful Server
        │
        ▼
    Hypervisor
        │
 ┌──────┼──────┐
 VM1   VM2   VM3
```

Multiple applications now share the same hardware safely.

---

## Building Analogy
Imagine one person living in a 10-floor building.

```
Building
│
├── Floor 1 → Used
├── Floor 2 → Empty
├── Floor 3 → Empty
├── Floor 4 → Empty
└── Remaining Floors Empty
```

Problems: Huge waste, Expensive, Inefficient

---

Now divide the building into apartments.

```
Building
│
├── Apartment A
├── Apartment B
├── Apartment C
└── Apartment D
```

Each apartment has: Own room, Own privacy, Own applications

**Shared:** Electricity, Water, Security, Lift

> Cheaper & More Efficient

---

### Mapping Analogy
| Building Example | Virtualization |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Building | Physical Server |
| Apartments | Virtual Machines |
| Tenants | Applications / OS |
| Building Manager | Hypervisor |

---

## Hypervisor
**Definition**

A Hypervisor is software that creates, manages and controls Virtual Machines.

It divides one physical computer into multiple virtual computers.

```
Physical Server
        │
        ▼
 Hypervisor
        │
 ┌──────┼──────┐
 VM1   VM2   VM3
```

**Responsibilities**

- Allocate CPU
- Allocate RAM
- Allocate Storage
- Allocate Network
- Start VM
- Stop VM
- Restart VM
- Clone VM
- Delete VM
- Isolation between VMs

---

## Virtual Machine (VM)
A VM behaves like a real computer.

Each VM has its own:

- CPU
- RAM
- Disk
- Network
- Operating System

**Example**

```
VM 1
├── Windows
├── 4 CPU
├── 8GB RAM
└── 100GB Disk

VM 2
├── Linux
├── 2 CPU
├── 4GB RAM
└── 50GB Disk
```

Both run on one physical machine.

---

## Key Advantages
 **Better Resource Utilization**

```
Old
CPU Usage
████░░░░░░ 10%

New
CPU Usage
████████░░ 80%
```

 **Cost Saving**

Less hardware → Less electricity → Less maintenance → Less cooling

---

 **Isolation**

If one VM crashes:

```
VM1 ❌
VM2 ✅
VM3 ✅
```

Others continue running.

---

 **Scalability**

Need more resources? Increase VM CPU/RAM instead of buying a new server.

---

### Important THM Answers

Answer: `physical server`

---

**Q. What software manages resources for lab machines?**

Answer: `hypervisor`

---

## Hypervisor Types
Hypervisors are divided into **two major types**.

```
                 Hypervisor
                     │
        ┌────────────┴────────────┐
        │                         │
     Type 1                  Type 2
(Bare Metal)             (Hosted)
```

## Managing Virtual Machines (THM Practical)
After learning virtualization, you'll often use a **Virtualization Manager** to monitor, create and manage Virtual Machines (VMs).

A Virtualization Manager provides:

- Overall virtualization status
- VM management
- Host monitoring
- Resource usage
- Start/Stop/Restart/Delete VMs

---

### Virtualization Dashboard
A typical dashboard contains three sections.

```
+------------------------------------------------------+
|                   Virtualization                     |
+------------------------------------------------------+

├── Stopped
├── Error
└── Resource Usage

Hosts
│
├── CPU
├── RAM
├── Storage
└── Network
```

---

## VM States
A Virtual Machine can exist in several states.

```
🟢 Running    — Application is active.
⚪ Stopped    — Powered Off.
🔴 Error      — VM failed. Needs troubleshooting or restart.
```

---

### THM Practical — Mail Server Issue
Virtual Machine: `Mail-SERVER`

Current Status: `ERROR`

**Solution**

```

Disk:   100 GB
```

→ Click `Create VM` → VM Added Successfully

**Newly Created VM**

```
Marketing-VM
Status:  Stopped
CPU:     4
RAM:     8 GB
Disk:    100 GB
```

---

### VM Resource Allocation
Every Virtual Machine receives dedicated resources.

```
Physical Server
  CPU, RAM, Storage, Network
        │
  Hypervisor
        │
    VM
      CPU
      RAM
      Disk
      IP Address
```

---

## Host Monitoring
Besides VMs, administrators also monitor Physical Hosts.

**Example 1**

```
Host:     HV-PROD-01
CPU:      45%
RAM:      68%
Storage:  72%
VMs:      3
Status:   Connected
```

**Example 2**

```
Host:     HV-PROD-02
CPU:      98%
RAM:      90%
Storage:  95%
VMs:      8
Status:   Connected
```

> Almost Full — Needs Attention

**Example 3**

```
Host:     HV-BACKUP-01
CPU:      0%
RAM:      0%
Storage:  30%
VMs:      0
Status:   Disconnected
```

---

### Reading Host Health
| Status | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Good | CPU < 70%, RAM < 70%, Storage < 80% |
| Warning | CPU > 90%, RAM > 90%, Storage > 90% |
| Critical | Disconnected, Server Offline, Hardware Failure |

---

### What Should Administrator Check?
