## 🧠 About

This is my personal collection of cybersecurity study notes from the **TryHackMe Pre Security path** and the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**, rebuilt as an interactive, gamified learning site.

Instead of a folder of markdown files, every topic is a "room" on a course map — with notes, diagrams, an interactive mindmap, and practice questions — all wrapped in a terminal/hacker aesthetic.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🗺️ **Gamified course maps** — TryHackMe-style learning paths with unique isometric 3D room icons
- 📝 **Full study notes** — styled dark tables, syntax-highlighted code, and atomic ASCII/monospace diagrams
- 🌳 **Interactive SVG mindmaps** — auto-laid-out concept trees with a clickable explorer panel
- 🎯 **Practice questions with hints**, key takeaways, and real-world scenario case studies
- 💻 **Terminal/hacker dark theme** — neon-green accents, animated details, ligature-free code
- 🔗 **Real URL routing** — deep-linkable rooms, refresh-safe, with scroll-position restore
- 📚 **79 rooms total** — **7 TryHackMe modules** (38 rooms) + **8 Google Cybersecurity courses** (41 rooms)
